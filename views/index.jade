		h2 Hi there.
		p This is a simple Nodejs + Express + MongoDB app that implements the popular 'testimonials' section you see on all the websites these days.  Users can write up a testimonial and it gets put in the database.  The website administrator can use the 'admin' page to choose which testimonials get displayed.  The source can be found at <a href="https://github.com/jkasala/testimonials">Github</a>.
		hr
		h2 To use:
		ul
			li You must have Node.js, the Express framework, and MongoDB installed.
			li Clone the repo and install dependencies:
				<pre>
				p git clone https://github.com/jkasala/testimonials.git 
				p cd testimonials
				p npm install
				</pre>
			li Create a new directory in the app folder called 'data', then tell mongoDB this is where the database files will live:
				<pre>
				p /path/to/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath data
				</pre>
			li Start the app:
				<pre>
				p npm start
				</pre>

				p You should now be able to access the app at http://localhost:3000
